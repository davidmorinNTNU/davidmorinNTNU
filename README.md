### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Morin and I am an associate professor at the Department of Structural Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu)) in Trondheim, Norway. I am associated to the research group [SIMLab](https://www.ntnu.edu/kt/simlab) (Structural IMpact Laboratory).

Research:

My research activities are linked to testing and modelling of materials, joints and structures subjected to large deformations and failure under various loading conditions (high and low speeds). I am an active developer in both python and FORTRAN where my codes are usually used in combination with Finite Element Analyses (FEA).

Teaching:

I am involved in two courses at NTNU, [TKT4140](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TKT4140#tab=omEmnet)-Numerical methods and [KT8306](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/KT8306#tab=omEmnet)-Plasticity Theory.

Education:

I earned my PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambresis (now UPHF) in 2010. My PhD thesis was on the topic of structural adhesives subjected to crash loadings.
